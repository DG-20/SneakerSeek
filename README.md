## What is SneakerSeek

SneakerSeek was designed to tackle the absence prevalent in local online shoe markets specifically targeting the untapped shoe enthusiast market. SneakerSeek is an online website designed for locals looking to sell and buy shoes within their city or region. SneakerSeek aims to resolve this absence by providing users a stylish and easy to use website which is powered by a well-organized database and corresponding endpoints. The website allows for users to search for shoe listings based on a variety of filters ranging from shoe brand to price range. Once finding their desired shoe, buyers can express interest in the listing by sharing their email and name with the seller. Sellers are able to view all interested buyers under their listing by viewing them on an easy to read page displaying all sale listings by the user. Buyers and sellers can then connect with each other over email and discuss terms that work for both parties separate from the website. SneakerSeek hopes to be the go-to online shoe sale market for avid shoe buyers and sellers, while connecting their interests and passion for shoes.
